# chestnut-code

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Mastra** - Agent framework with Hono integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Electrobun** - Lightweight desktop shell for web frontends

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3151](http://localhost:3151) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3150](http://localhost:3150).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@chestnut-code/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Agent chat uses `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`. Set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `apps/server/.env` or your deployment environment before starting the server.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`
